To run the full set of calculations to reproduce the results from the
main paper, use:
  csh make_all
to create all the subdirectories.

Then change directory into each subdirectory in turn and run the
'run_all.csh' script:
  cd rcp85-xxx
  csh run_all.csh >& run_all.log &
  cd ..

Jobs may require up to ~16Gb of memory (8Gb plus swap is useable),
so only one job will run at a time on most hardware.

If you are using the netcdf4-python library rather than Scientific.IO,
overwrite ncblendmask.py and ncblendhadcrut.py with the -nc4 versions.

See the 'README' file for more details.

The netcdf files have been regridded from the original CMIP5 and HadCRUT4
data using CDO.
